From the class I took about Natural Language Processing and a bit of Data Science.

Create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Ensure you're using a version of python<3.13 since python 3.13 doesn't support numpy<2.0.
Numpy<2.0 is required for gensim to work.

Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
